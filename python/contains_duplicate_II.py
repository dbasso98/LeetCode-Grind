# O(n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity at most. We donâ€™t need the abs since we are always looking at previous positions (not next ones).

# Pattern:
# Use an hash table to store the position of a number in the array. Then if it is already present and the difference between the actual number and the stored one is inside the k range return True.
