# O(n) and O(n) space complexity.

# Pattern:
# Basically we have to take care of the odd occurrences. First compute overall occurrences as usual. 
# Then, weâ€™re gonna add to the palindrome all the even occurrences and all the odd 
# ones (always subtracting by 1 to make them even) and then if at least one odd occurrence has been added we can sum 1 to the result.
